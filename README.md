# My React Practice Projects

Well on 26 January 2024, I decided to upgrade the infrastructure of my website, but was tight in budget. Already made websites in HTML CSS and PHP, so Tried to learn React and NEXTJS. I have a timeline of 30 days to learn, build and deploy the website. In my repository you can check the websites I have made to practice React. 


I will be making another repository of websites I made on NEXTJS. 
For DEMO, I dont have any server, so I dont know how to deploy it for now atleast. But will be attaching screenshots later.
